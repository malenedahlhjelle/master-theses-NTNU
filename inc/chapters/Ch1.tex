\chapter{Kinematic closed-loop model for ROV}
\label{chap:ch1}
The model assumes the low level control is already implemented and follows the reference with a top speed and turning rate. The model is in 2.5D, which means the depth is decoupled from the x and y. The output from the Guidance system is the desired speed, depth and turning rate.
